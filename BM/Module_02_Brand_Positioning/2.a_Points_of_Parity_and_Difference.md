# Identifying and Establishing Brand Positioning

Brand positioning is a strategic process focused on defining how a brand is perceived in the minds of consumers relative to its competitors. This involves identifying and establishing Points of Parity (POP) and Points of Difference (POD) to differentiate the brand while ensuring relevance and competitiveness in the market.

## Points of Parity (POP) and Points of Difference (POD)

### Points of Parity (POP)
- **Definition:** POP refers to the essential attributes or benefits that consumers expect from all brands within a particular category. These are the fundamental characteristics necessary for a brand to be considered credible within its market.
- **Significance:** Establishing POP ensures that the brand meets the basic expectations of its category, making it a legitimate player in the market.

### Points of Difference (POD)
- **Definition:** POD refers to the unique attributes or benefits that set a brand apart from its competitors. These are the distinguishing factors that give consumers a reason to choose one brand over others.
- **Significance:** PODs form the foundation of a brand's unique value proposition, providing a competitive edge.

### Key Considerations:
- **Who Are the Consumers?**
  - The consumers are the target audience that the brand aims to serve. Understanding their demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and geographic characteristics is crucial.
- **Who Are the Competitors?**
  - Competitors are other brands in the same or related categories that vie for the attention and loyalty of the same target market. Analyzing competitors helps in identifying where the brand stands in comparison.
- **How Are the Brands Similar?**
  - Identifying similarities helps in establishing POP by ensuring the brand is seen as a legitimate player within its category.
- **How Are the Brands Different?**
  - Differentiation is key to establishing POD. It could be in terms of features, quality, price, brand personality, customer service, or emotional connection.

## Target Market â€“ Segmentation Bases and Criteria

### Segmentation Bases
1. **Demographic Segmentation:** Age, gender, income, education, occupation, family size, and life stage.
2. **Psychographic Segmentation:** Lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes, interests, and opinions.
3. **Behavioral Segmentation:** Purchasing behavior, user status, usage rate, brand loyalty, and benefits sought.
4. **Geographic Segmentation:** Region, city size, climate, and population density.

### Segmentation Criteria
1. **Identifiability:** The ability to identify distinct segments within the market.
2. **Size:** The segment must be large enough to be profitable.
3. **Accessibility:** The ability to effectively reach and serve the segment.
4. **Responsiveness:** The segment should respond differently to marketing strategies compared to others.

## Positioning Guidelines

### Frame of Reference
1. **Category Benefits:**
   - The key benefits associated with the category that the brand should deliver.
2. **Product Descriptor:**
   - A clear description of what the product or service is and what it does.

### Choosing Points of Difference (POD)
1. **Desirability:**
   - The POD must be something that consumers desire and find important.
2. **Deliverability:**
   - The brand must be capable of delivering on the POD, ensuring feasibility and effective communication.
3. **Differentiation Criteria:**
   - The POD must be truly unique and not easily replicated by competitors.

## Establishing Points of Parity (POP) and Points of Difference (POD)

### Separate the Attributes
- Identify which attributes are essential for category membership (POP) and which can be leveraged as unique selling points (POD).

### Leverage Equity of Another Entity
- Sometimes a brand can leverage the equity of another entity, such as a partner brand or a celebrity endorser, to establish credibility or differentiation.

### Redefine the Relationship
- Brands can redefine the relationship between attributes and benefits to create unique positioning. This might involve highlighting a common attribute in a new or unexpected way to establish a POD.

## Update Positions Over Time

### Laddering
- Laddering involves deepening the brand positioning by connecting the brand's benefits to higher-order emotional needs or values. This helps in maintaining relevance as the market evolves.

### Reacting
- Reacting involves updating the brand's POP and POD in response to market changes, such as shifts in consumer preferences or competitive actions, to maintain its positioning in the market.
