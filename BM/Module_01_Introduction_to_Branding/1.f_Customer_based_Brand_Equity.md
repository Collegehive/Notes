#  Customer based Brand Equity

## Overview
Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) refers to the value a brand holds in the minds and hearts of customers. According to Kevin Lane Keller, CBBE is defined as the differential effect that brand knowledge has on consumer response to the marketing of that brand. The power of a brand lies in what consumers think, feel, and perceive about the brand based on their experiences.

## Rationale of the CBBE Model
- **Basic Premise**: The strength of a brand is rooted in the minds of customers.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring that customers have the right types of experiences with products, services, and marketing efforts to create positive brand knowledge structures.
  - **Key Elements of Brand Knowledge**:
    - **Thoughts**
    - **Feelings**
    - **Images**
    - **Perceptions**
    - **Attitudes**

## Building Customer-Based Brand Equity
- **Branding Ladder**: Building a strong brand involves a series of steps, often visualized as a ladder.
- **Brand Building Blocks**: A strong brand is characterized by well-defined brand building blocks, which identify areas of strength and weakness and provide guidance for marketing activities.
