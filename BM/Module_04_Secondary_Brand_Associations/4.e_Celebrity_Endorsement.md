#  Celebrity Endorsement

**Celebrity Endorsement** is a marketing strategy that leverages a celebrity’s fame, image, and influence to promote a brand, product, or service. This approach, also known as **celebrity branding** or **celebrity advertising**, involves associating a well-known public figure with a brand to enhance its appeal, increase visibility, and attract the celebrity’s fan base.

Celebrity endorsement involves a brand hiring a celebrity to represent or promote its products. The celebrity’s popularity and influence help create a strong association between the celebrity’s image and the brand. This can lead to increased trust, enhanced brand perception, and higher consumer interest.
