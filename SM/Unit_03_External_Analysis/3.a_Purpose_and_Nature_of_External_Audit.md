# Purpose and Nature of External Audit

## Purpose of External Audit
An external audit is a crucial component of the strategic management process, aimed at identifying and evaluating the external factors that affect an organization’s ability to achieve its objectives. The primary purpose of an external audit is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the external environment in which an organization operates, including opportunities and threats that could influence its success. By systematically analyzing these factors, organizations can develop strategies that capitalize on opportunities and mitigate potential risks.

External audits serve several key purposes:
- **Identifying Opportunities:** External audits help organizations identify favorable conditions and trends in the external environment that can be leveraged for growth, expansion, or competitive advantage.
- **Recognizing Threats:** They also help in identifying external threats that could hinder an organization’s performance, such as new competitors, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer behavior.
- **Informing Strategic Decisions:** The insights gained from an external audit guide strategic decision-making, ensuring that the organization’s strategies are aligned with the external environment.
- **Enhancing Adaptability:** By understanding external forces, organizations can adapt more quickly to changes in the market, technology, or regulations, thereby maintaining or improving their competitive position.

## Nature of External Audit
The nature of an external audit is broad and multifaceted, encompassing a wide range of external factors that impact an organization. Unlike internal audits, which focus on the internal workings of an organization, external audits are concerned with factors outside the organization’s control. These factors can be categorized into various domains, such as economic, political, social, technological, environmental, and legal (often referred to as PESTEL analysis).

### Key Characteristics of External Audit:
- **Comprehensive:** External audits cover a wide array of external factors, from economic conditions to technological advancements, all of which could have significant impacts on the organization.
- **Dynamic:** The external environment is constantly changing, making the external audit a dynamic process that requires continuous monitoring and updating.
- **Objective:** External audits rely on objective data and analysis to provide an accurate assessment of the external environment. This often involves gathering information from various external sources, including market reports, industry analyses, government publications, and expert opinions.
- **Proactive:** A proactive external audit enables organizations to anticipate changes in the environment and adjust their strategies accordingly, rather than merely reacting to changes after they occur.

### Steps in Conducting an External Audit:
1. **Scanning the Environment:** This involves identifying and monitoring the key external factors that could impact the organization. These factors are typically categorized into broader areas such as political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal (PESTEL framework).
2. **Analyzing External Forces:** Once identified, these external factors are analyzed to determine their potential impact on the organization. This analysis helps in understanding how each factor could present opportunities or threats.
3. **Evaluating the Impact:** The next step is to evaluate the significance of these external forces, assessing how they could affect the organization’s current and future performance.
4. **Developing Strategic Responses:** Based on the analysis, organizations develop strategic responses that align with the external environment. This might involve capitalizing on emerging opportunities or taking steps to mitigate identified threats.

## Conclusion
The purpose and nature of an external audit are centered on understanding the external environment that influences an organization’s strategic decisions. By systematically examining external factors, organizations can better anticipate changes, identify opportunities, mitigate risks, and align their strategies with the realities of the external environment. This process is essential for maintaining competitiveness and achieving long-term success in a constantly evolving market landscape.
