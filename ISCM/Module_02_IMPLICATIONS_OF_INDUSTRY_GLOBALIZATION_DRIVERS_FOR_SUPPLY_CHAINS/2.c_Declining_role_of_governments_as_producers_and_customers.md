## Governmentâ€™s Evolving Role in Trade and Logistics

In principle, governments should continue to play a public role by investing in trade facilitation and logistics infrastructure to address supply chain bottlenecks. For instance:

- **Modernizing and digitalizing customs and port processes**: This allows for faster trade flow, even during times of sudden regulatory changes, such as those seen during the pandemic.

Governments significantly impact the costs, speed, and reliability of logistics operations through their policies, including:

- **Taxes and regulations**
- **Energy policies**
- **Import/export procedures**

These government-driven processes influence the decisions of shippers and carriers regarding whether to operate within a given region. By facilitating trade infrastructure and minimizing bureaucratic hurdles, governments can make regions more attractive for global business.
