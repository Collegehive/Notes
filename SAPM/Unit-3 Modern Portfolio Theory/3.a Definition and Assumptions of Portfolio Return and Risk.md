# Definitions and Assumptions

Before diving into portfolio theory and its applications, it's crucial to establish a common nomenclature. Understanding these key terms correctly is essential for interpreting the upcoming series.

## Definitions

### Return
For many assets, the return may include:
- **Capital appreciation**: For stocks, this is when the price rises.
- **Dividends**: For stocks, these are payments made to shareholders out of the company's profits.
- **Price appreciation**: For debt instruments, this could occur when interest rates fall.
- **Periodic interest payments**: For bonds and other debt instruments.
- **Principal payment**: This refers to the repayment of the initial amount borrowed.

Expected returns might be based on historical performance, but it's important to critically evaluate whether past trends can reliably predict future outcomes. For example, projecting a 50% year-over-year rise in technology stocks over the next decade may be overly optimistic.

### Risk
Risk is defined as the variability in the expected return. This series will employ simple statistical tools to quantify risk, which typically relies on historical volatility. However, investors should critically assess the assumptions used in risk estimation. Recent financial crises have demonstrated that assets previously thought to be uncorrelated can become highly correlated under certain economic conditions.

## Assumptions in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) relies on several assumptions about investors and markets, some explicit and others implicit. These assumptions are not entirely accurate and can compromise the theory to a degree.

### Assumptions Include:

- **Normal Distribution of Returns**: Asset returns are often assumed to be jointly normally distributed. However, real-world data shows that returns are not normally distributed, with large swings more frequent than the model predicts.
- **Constant Correlations**: The theory assumes that correlations between assets are fixed. In reality, correlations vary with changes in systemic relationships, such as economic or political events.
- **Economic Utility Maximization**: All investors are assumed to aim to maximize economic utility, i.e., making as much money as possible.
- **Rational and Risk-Averse Investors**: Investors are assumed to be rational and risk-averse, contradicting behavioral economics findings that demonstrate irrational and sometimes risk-seeking behaviors.
- **Equal Information Access**: It's assumed all investors have access to the same information at the same time, ignoring realities like information asymmetry and insider trading.
- **Accurate Return Conceptions**: Investors are presumed to have an accurate perception of possible returns, which is often not the case.
- **No Taxes or Transaction Costs**: The theory often neglects taxes and transaction costs, which can significantly affect portfolio decisions.
- **Price Taker Assumption**: Investors are assumed to be price takers, not influencing prices with their actions, which is not valid for large trades.
- **Unlimited Borrowing at Risk-Free Rate**: It assumes investors can lend and borrow unlimited amounts at the risk-free rate, disregarding credit limits.
- **Divisibility of Securities**: All securities are assumed to be divisible into any size, which is not practical with certain assets.

### Enhanced Models

More complex versions of MPT attempt to address these assumptions by incorporating more realistic scenarios, like non-normal distributions and the impact of taxes. However, all financial models, to some extent, rest on simplifications of the real world.

This framework sets the stage for a deeper exploration of portfolio theory, where these definitions and assumptions will be referenced and tested against practical scenarios.
