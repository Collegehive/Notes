# Total Risk

**Total Risk** in an investment context refers to the overall uncertainty or variability of returns that an investor may experience. It encompasses all the potential sources of risk that could affect the returns on an investment. Understanding total risk is crucial for investors as it helps them evaluate the potential volatility of their investment and the likelihood of achieving their expected returns.

Total risk is composed of two primary components:

1. **Systematic Risk**
2. **Unsystematic Risk**

## 1. Systematic Risk

**Systematic Risk** (also known as market risk or non-diversifiable risk) is the risk that affects the entire market or a large segment of the market. It is driven by factors that influence the overall economy or financial markets, such as economic recessions, interest rate changes, inflation, political instability, or natural disasters.

Systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification because it impacts all securities to some extent. Since it is inherent to the market as a whole, systematic risk is often considered unavoidable, and investors need to be aware of its potential impact on their portfolio.

#### Examples of Systematic Risk:
- **Market Risk**: The risk of losses due to overall market movements. For example, during a market downturn, the prices of most stocks tend to fall, regardless of the company's individual performance.
- **Interest Rate Risk**: The risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of investments, particularly bonds. When interest rates rise, bond prices typically fall.
- **Inflation Risk**: The risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of returns. High inflation can reduce the real value of future cash flows from investments.
- **Political Risk**: The risk of political instability or changes in government policy that could negatively impact the financial markets.

## 2. Unsystematic Risk

**Unsystematic Risk** (also known as specific risk, diversifiable risk, or idiosyncratic risk) is the risk that is unique to a particular company or industry. It arises from factors that are specific to a single company or industry, such as management decisions, labor strikes, product recalls, or regulatory changes affecting a particular sector.

Unlike systematic risk, unsystematic risk can be significantly reduced or even eliminated through diversification. By holding a well-diversified portfolio of different assets, investors can spread out their exposure to unsystematic risks, minimizing the impact of any single asset's poor performance on the overall portfolio.

#### Examples of Unsystematic Risk:
- **Business Risk**: The risk associated with the operational efficiency and management of a company. For example, poor management decisions, production failures, or supply chain disruptions can adversely affect a company's profitability.
  - **Internal Business Risk**: Risks related to the internal operations of the company, such as operational inefficiencies or poor decision-making.
  - **External Business Risk**: Risks related to external factors, such as competition, changes in consumer preferences, or economic conditions affecting the industry.
- **Financial Risk**: The risk associated with a company's capital structure, particularly the use of debt. High levels of debt increase the risk of financial distress if the company cannot meet its interest obligations.

## 3. Total Risk: The Combination of Systematic and Unsystematic Risk

**Total Risk** is the sum of systematic risk and unsystematic risk. It represents the full spectrum of potential variability in an investment's returns. The total risk of an investment is important for investors to understand because it encompasses all possible risks that could affect their portfolio's performance.

#### Total Risk Formula:
\[
\text{Total Risk} = \text{Systematic Risk} + \text{Unsystematic Risk}
\]

Since systematic risk cannot be diversified away, investors must accept it as part of their investment strategy. However, they can reduce unsystematic risk through diversification, thereby lowering the total risk of their investment portfolio.

### Risk Measurement and Its Importance

Risk is typically measured using standard deviation, which quantifies the extent of variability in an investment's returns relative to its mean return. A higher standard deviation indicates greater risk, as it suggests that the returns are more likely to deviate from the expected value.

#### Formula for Standard Deviation:
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i \cdot \left( R_i - E(R) \right)^2 }
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation,
- \( P_i \) is the probability of each scenario,
- \( R_i \) is the return in each scenario,
- \( E(R) \) is the expected return.

Standard deviation is a key tool for assessing total risk because it captures the combined effect of both systematic and unsystematic risks on the variability of returns.

### Conclusion: Managing Total Risk

Investors need to be aware of total risk when constructing their portfolios. While systematic risk is unavoidable, investors can mitigate unsystematic risk through diversification. By holding a diversified portfolio, investors can reduce the total risk and increase the likelihood of achieving more stable and predictable returns.

Understanding the components of total risk allows investors to make informed decisions about their risk tolerance, asset allocation, and investment strategy, ultimately helping them achieve their financial goals.
