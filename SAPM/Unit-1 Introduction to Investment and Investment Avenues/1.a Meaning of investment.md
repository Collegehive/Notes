## Science or Art?

Investing requires quantitative analysis and an understanding of financial theories (the science), as well as insight into market sentiment and economic indicators (the art).

## Risk and Return

These concepts are intertwined. Risk refers to the potential for actual returns to differ from expected returns, while return is the gain or loss on an investment. Generally, the potential for higher returns is associated with a higher level of risk.

## Perspectives on Investment

- **General Sense**: Purchases like cars or appliances, which are not consumed immediately but can create future wealth.
- **Economic Investment**: Capital formation, such as new construction or equipment, essential for a country's development.
- **Business Investment**: Resource allocation in business to generate future profits, including product development or facility expansion.
- **Financial Investment**: Placing capital into assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate, aiming for income or capital appreciation.

Investment is crucial across different contexts for wealth creation and economic growth, requiring a blend of analytical and intuitive approaches.
