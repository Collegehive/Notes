### Regulatory Burdens
Frequent changes in regulations, compliance requirements, and bureaucratic hurdles add to the operational costs and complexities for MSMEs. Navigating through these regulatory frameworks demands resources that many small businesses do not possess.

## 2. Infrastructure

### Inadequate Infrastructure
Many MSMEs operate in areas with poor infrastructure, including inadequate power supply, transportation, and logistics facilities. This not only affects their production efficiency but also increases their operational costs significantly.

## 3. Low Productivity & Lack of Innovation

### Challenges in Productivity
MSMEs often face issues with low productivity due to outdated technologies, inefficient processes, and unskilled labor. This limits their competitiveness on both national and international platforms.

### Innovation Hurdles
Limited resources and focus on day-to-day survival mean that innovation takes a backseat in many MSMEs. Without innovation, these enterprises struggle to differentiate themselves and capture new market opportunities.

## 4. Technical Changes

### Adapting to Technology
Rapid technological advancements mean that MSMEs must continuously adapt to stay relevant. However, the cost of adopting new technologies and the lack of technical expertise pose significant challenges.

## 5. Competition & Skills

### Intense Competition
MSMEs face stiff competition from larger corporations and global entities, making it difficult to retain market share and customer loyalty.

### Skill Gaps
There is often a lack of skilled labor within the MSME sector, affecting all aspects of business operations, from management to production, and marketing.

## 6. Lack of Professionalism

### Professional Practices
Many MSMEs are family-owned or managed without professional business practices, affecting their efficiency, productivity, and ultimately, profitability.

## 7. Lack of Standardized Policies

### Policy Inconsistency
The absence of standardized policies for the MSME sector leads to an uneven playing field, where businesses often find it challenging to operate efficiently and plan for the long term.
