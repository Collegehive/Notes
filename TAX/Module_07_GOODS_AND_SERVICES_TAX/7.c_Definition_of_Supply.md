# 7.c Definition of Supply
 

In the GST system, a **taxable event** is defined as a "Supply." For any transaction to be recognized as a supply by the government, it must meet certain criteria. Supply encompasses the sale, transfer, exchange, or lease of goods and services within the taxable territory and forms the basis for taxation under GST.

Supply under GST serves as the fundamental taxable event and must meet specific criteria regarding goods, consideration, territory, and business intent. By clearly defining the **place, value, and time of supply**, GST ensures the consistent and equitable application of tax on goods and services, thereby maintaining transparency and simplicity in India’s tax structure.

## Characteristics of Supply

For an event to qualify as a supply under GST, it should fulfill the following conditions:
- **Goods or Services**: The supply must involve goods or services.
- **Taxable**: The supply must fall within the category of taxable items under GST.
- **Made by a Taxable Person**: The supply should be made by a person or entity registered under GST.
- **Within a Taxable Territory**: The supply should take place within India’s taxable territory.
- **For Consideration**: The supply must be made in exchange for cash or another form of reward (consideration).
- **In the Course of Business**: The supply must be made with the intent of conducting or expanding a business.

## Components of Supply Under GST

A supply under GST has three key components that help determine the tax implications for each transaction:

- **Place of Supply**: Determines whether the transaction is intra-state (within the same state), inter-state (between states), or external trade. This classification defines whether CGST & SGST or IGST will apply.
- **Value of Supply**: Determines the taxable value of the supply, which is essential for calculating the tax amount due.
- **Time of Supply**: Identifies the point in time when the tax is due, also determining when GST returns should be filed.

## Types of Supply Under GST

Supplies under GST are broadly categorized into **Taxable Supplies** and **Non-Taxable Supplies**. These categories are further divided based on the nature of the supply.

### 1. Taxable Supplies
Taxable supplies refer to the goods and/or services that are taxable under GST.

- **Regular Taxable Supplies**: Any supply of goods or services that attracts a GST rate above 0% within India. This includes most goods and services sold domestically.
- **Nil-Rated Supplies**: Goods or services that have a default GST rate of 0%. These items are taxed at 0% within India.
- **Zero-Rated Supplies**: Supplies that are taxed at 0% GST specifically in the context of exports, supplies to Special Economic Zones (SEZs), or deemed exports. Although they would normally attract a GST rate if sold domestically, they are considered zero-rated under these conditions.

### 2. Non-Taxable Supplies
Non-taxable supplies refer to goods or services that do not attract GST, even though they fall within the GST framework.

- **Exempt Supplies**: Certain goods or services are exempt from GST. However, a registered taxpayer cannot claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) on the inputs used to make such exempt supplies.
- **Non-GST Supplies**: Items that fall entirely outside the GST law. These supplies are not taxed under GST and include items that are part of the state's separate taxation powers, such as petroleum products and alcohol.

## Composite and Mixed Supplies

GST also considers transactions involving multiple goods and/or services in a single supply:

- **Composite Supply**: A supply involving two or more goods or services, where one is the principal supply. The tax rate for a composite supply is determined by the rate applicable to the principal supply.
- **Mixed Supply**: A combination of two or more independent supplies of goods or services that are bundled together for a single price. The tax rate for mixed supplies is the highest rate applicable to any of the individual components.
