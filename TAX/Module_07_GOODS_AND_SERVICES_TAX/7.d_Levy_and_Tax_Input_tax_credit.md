# 7.d Levy and Tax Input tax credit
 

**Input Tax Credit (ITC)** is a fundamental provision under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework, serving to reduce the cascading effect of taxes and ensuring tax collection at the destination of consumption. As GST is a destination-based tax, ITC allows businesses to claim credit for the tax paid on inputs, which can then be used to offset the tax liability on outputs.

## Definition of Input Tax Credit (ITC)
According to **Section 2(56) of the CGST Act**, "Input Tax Credit" refers to the credit of "input tax" that a registered taxpayer can claim on inputs (goods or services) used to make taxable supplies.

## Importance of ITC in GST
- ITC prevents **tax cascading** by allowing businesses to deduct the input tax paid on goods or services they purchase, ensuring that GST is applied only to the value added at each stage of the supply chain.
- It aligns with GSTâ€™s **destination-based structure**, where tax revenue is ultimately collected in the state where goods or services are consumed.

## Claiming Input Tax Credit
Under GST, a taxable person wishing to claim ITC must provide proof of eligibility. **Section 155 of the CGST Act** states that the burden of proving ITC eligibility lies with the person claiming the credit.

### ITC can be claimed on:
1. **Basic Customs Duty and IGST**: Paid at the time of imports by the importer.
2. **Inter-State Purchases**: The IGST paid by the purchaser is eligible for ITC.
3. **Intra-State Purchases**: The CGST and SGST paid by the purchaser are also eligible for ITC.

## Utilization of Input Tax Credit

ITC can be applied to reduce GST liabilities in specific scenarios, ensuring tax is paid only on the net value added:

1. **Exports and Supplies to SEZs**: These are considered **zero-rated supplies** and are exempt from GST. ITC can be used to offset other tax liabilities in the case of these supplies.
2. **Inter-State Supplies**: ITC on IGST can be utilized by the supplier when making taxable inter-state supplies.
3. **Intra-State Supplies**: ITC on CGST and SGST can be utilized by the supplier for intra-state supplies.

## Levy and Tax Collection under ITC

The **levy of tax** and subsequent collection under ITC involves:
- **Offsetting Input and Output Tax**: By allowing credit on input tax, businesses pay GST only on the value they add to the product/service, ultimately passing on the tax liability to the end consumer.
- **Streamlined Tax Compliance**: The ITC system encourages compliance and efficient tracking of tax credits, as each registered taxpayer is accountable for maintaining accurate records to support their claims.

## Summary

In essence, **Input Tax Credit** is the backbone of GST, reducing tax liabilities for businesses, minimizing tax-on-tax, and ensuring fair tax collection at the destination of consumption. By facilitating tax credits on inputs, ITC fosters a streamlined, transparent, and fair GST system across India.
