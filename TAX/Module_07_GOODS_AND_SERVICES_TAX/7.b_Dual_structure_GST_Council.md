# 7.b Dual structure GST Council

The **dual structure council** under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework is established to enable cooperative administration and policy-making between the Central and State Governments. Given the dual tax nature of GST, where both the Centre and States share responsibilities, the GST Council plays a pivotal role in harmonizing the tax structure, rates, and policies.

The **dual structure council** under GST enables cooperative governance, balancing revenue distribution, uniform taxation, and efficient administration between the Centre and states. This framework allows the Centre and states to operate cohesively within India’s federal structure, creating a fair and transparent tax system that benefits all regions.

## 1. Components of Dual GST

The dual structure of GST in India comprises four components that apply based on the location and nature of the transaction (intra-state or inter-state):

- **Central GST (CGST)**: Levied by the **Central Government** on intra-state (within the same state) supply of goods and services. The revenue from CGST is allocated to the Centre.
- **State GST (SGST)**: Levied by the **State Government** on intra-state supplies within the respective state. The revenue from SGST goes to the state where the transaction occurs.
- **Union Territory GST (UTGST)**: Applied in Union Territories without their own legislature (e.g., Chandigarh) and collected by the central administration instead of SGST.
- **Integrated GST (IGST)**: Levied on inter-state (between different states) transactions of goods and services. Collected by the **Central Government**, IGST is later distributed between the Centre and the state where the goods/services are consumed, ensuring that the destination state benefits from the tax revenue.

## 2. GST Council's Role in Dual GST Structure

The **GST Council** is the governing body for GST, established under Article 279A of the Indian Constitution. It consists of representatives from the Central Government and each state government, with the Union Finance Minister as the Chairperson. The Council provides a platform for the Centre and states to jointly make decisions on key GST issues.

- **Coordination of Tax Rates and Policies**: The Council determines tax rates under the dual GST structure, ensuring uniformity across the nation. This consistency prevents tax competition between states and enables businesses to operate under a single tax structure.
- **Defining Place, Value, and Time of Supply**: The Council sets guidelines for determining the place, value, and timing of a supply transaction, crucial for identifying the applicable GST component. The “place of supply” identifies whether a transaction is intra-state or inter-state, determining whether CGST/SGST or IGST applies.
- **Classifying Types of Supplies**: The Council oversees the classification of transactions into taxable supplies (regular, nil-rated, zero-rated) and non-taxable supplies (exempt and non-GST supplies). This standardization ensures appropriate application of GST.

## 3. Mechanism for Smooth Tax Flow

The GST Council establishes a seamless tax flow mechanism, even when goods and services cross state boundaries. For instance:

- **Intra-State Transactions**: Both CGST and SGST are applied and collected, with the revenue equally split between the Centre and State.
- **Inter-State Transactions**: IGST is applied, collected by the Centre, and redistributed to the state where the goods/services are consumed.

This mechanism promotes **revenue neutrality** for states, ensuring an equitable distribution of tax revenue based on consumption.

## 4. Examples of Dual GST in Action

- **Intra-State Transaction Example**: An auto component manufacturer in Pune, Maharashtra, sells goods within the state to Mumbai. Here, both CGST and SGST are levied, with revenue shared equally between the Central Government and Maharashtra State Government.
  
- **Inter-State Transaction Example**: If the same manufacturer in Pune dispatches goods to Ahmedabad, Gujarat, then IGST applies. The Centre collects IGST and later distributes a portion of it to Gujarat, where the goods are consumed.

# GST Council of India

The **Goods & Services Tax Council (GST Council)** is a constitutional body responsible for recommending measures to the Union and State Governments on various issues related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The GST Council plays a crucial role in ensuring the effective administration of GST by promoting cooperation and coordination between the Centre and the States.

## Points to remember 
- The **GST Council** was established through a **Presidential order issued in 2016**, setting the foundation for its creation.
- The **Secretariat of the Council** is located in **New Delhi**.

## Structure of the GST Council

The GST Council is a joint forum comprising members from both the Centre and the States. Its structure includes:

- **Chairperson**: The **Union Finance Minister** serves as the Chairperson of the Council.
- **Union Minister of State**: The Minister of State in charge of Revenue or Finance.
- **State Representatives**: Each state nominates a Minister in charge of Finance or Taxation (or another nominated minister) as its representative.
- **Vice-Chairperson**: The state members elect one member among themselves as the Vice-Chairperson of the Council.
- **Permanent Invitee**: The **Chairperson of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC)** is included as a permanent invitee (non-voting) in all Council proceedings.
- The **Union Revenue Secretary** acts as the ex-officio Secretary to the Council.

## Duties of the GST Council

The primary duties of the GST Council involve making decisions on the following aspects of GST:

- Determining the **taxes, cesses, and surcharges** levied by the Centre, States, and local bodies that should be subsumed under GST.
- Setting the **GST rates** and classifying items as **exempted** or **non-exempted**.
- Establishing the **turnover threshold** for GST registration.
- Deciding on **special rates** as needed for specific goods and services.
- Discussing the **inclusion of petroleum, diesel, and other commodities** under GST, as per the Council’s discretion.

Through these duties, the GST Council ensures the streamlined functioning of GST across India, balancing the tax needs of the Centre and States while simplifying the tax structure for consumers and businesses alike.
