# 2.b Treatment of Various Allowances

## Understanding Allowances Under Section 10 of the Income Tax Act, 1961
Allowances are a fixed amount of cash or benefits regularly given to salaried employees in addition to their salary. These allowances are meant to cover specific needs related to the employee's service or to compensate for working under certain conditions. Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, certain allowances are exempt from taxation, either fully or partially, under Section 10.
