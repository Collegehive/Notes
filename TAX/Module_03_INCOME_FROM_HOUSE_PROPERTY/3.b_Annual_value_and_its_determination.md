# 3.b Annual value and its determination
# Determination of Annual Value [Section 23]

The determination of the annual value of a property, which is essential for computing the income from house property, involves the following steps:

1. **Determination of Gross Annual Value (GAV):**
   - **Gross Annual Value** is the potential annual rent a property can fetch if it is let out. It is the maximum amount that the property could reasonably be expected to earn in a year, regardless of whether it is actually let out or not.

2. **Municipal Tax Deduction:**
   - From the Gross Annual Value, the municipal taxes paid by the owner during the previous year are deducted. These taxes must be paid by the owner and not merely due, meaning that only the taxes actually paid during the year are eligible for deduction.

3. **Net Annual Value (NAV):**
   - The result after deducting the municipal taxes from the Gross Annual Value is termed as the **Net Annual Value (NAV)**. This Net Annual Value is the amount that is subject to taxation under the head "Income from house property."

### Explanation of the Process:
- The **Gross Annual Value (GAV)** represents the estimated rental income for the property. This value considers factors such as the location of the property, demand for rental space in the area, and market trends.
- **Municipal taxes** are a compulsory expense paid to local government authorities. These taxes help fund public services such as water supply, maintenance of roads, and sanitation. Deducting these taxes from the GAV acknowledges that they are necessary expenditures required to maintain ownership of the property.
- **Net Annual Value (NAV)** is the final figure used for tax purposes. It represents the true income from the property after accounting for necessary deductions like municipal taxes. This value is critical for calculating the taxable income under the Income from House Property head.

This process ensures that the property owner is only taxed on the actual income derived from the property, rather than an inflated gross figure that does not take necessary expenses into account.
