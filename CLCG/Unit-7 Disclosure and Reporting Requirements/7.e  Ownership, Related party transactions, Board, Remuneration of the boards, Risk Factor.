# Disclosures-Ownership 

Ownership disclosures, as mandated by corporate regulations such as the Companies Act, 2013, play a critical role in enhancing transparency about who holds significant control and influence over a company. This type of disclosure is key for stakeholders including investors, regulators, and the public, providing essential information that helps in understanding potential conflicts of interest and assessing the power dynamics within a corporation.

What Gets Disclosed:
Promoters:

Promoters are typically the initial subscribers to the company’s Memorandum of Association and are instrumental in the company's formation. They are required to disclose their shareholding percentage, which reveals the extent of their control or influence over the company.
Promoter Group:

This category extends beyond the individual promoters to include their family members and any companies that the promoters control. The disclosure of the promoter group’s combined shareholding percentage is crucial as it highlights the aggregate influence exerted by a connected group of individuals and entities over the corporate decisions and governance.
Public Shareholding:

The share of the company that is held by the public—including individual investors and institutional stakeholders—is also disclosed. This is vital for understanding the distribution of company ownership beyond the core group of promoters and their associates.
