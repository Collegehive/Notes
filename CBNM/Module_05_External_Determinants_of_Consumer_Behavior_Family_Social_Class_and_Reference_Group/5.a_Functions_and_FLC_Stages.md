# 5.a Functions and FLC Stages

The family life cycle is a composite variable that combines marital 
status, size of family, age of family members (focusing on the age of the 
oldest or youngest child), and employment status of the head of household, and then classifies the family into a “typical” stage.

*The Family as a Socialization Agent*

*Socialization* refers to the process of teaching people behave in a way that is acceptable to their 
society. In the context of marketing, the most important role of the family is the socialization of family members, ranging from young children to adults. This process includes imparting to children the basic values and modes of behavior consistent with their culture, including moral principles, interpersonal skills, dress and grooming standards, appropriate manners and speech, and the selection of suitable educational and occupational or career goals.
Parents are increasingly involved in their children's socialization due to the competitive job market, aiming to give them an advantage from a young age. This leads to packed schedules with preschool, after-school activities, and weekend programs. 

*Consumer Socialization*
Definition: Consumer socialization is the process where children learn the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values to function as consumers. This process shapes how they perceive products, brands, and consumption in general.

*Family Supportive Roles*
Economic Well-Being: The family provides financial resources, ensuring the support and adequate allocation of funds for all members' needs, from housing and food to education and healthcare​.

Emotional Support: Families offer love, affection, and emotional security to each other. This role traditionally fell to mothers, but with more dual-income households, both parents now play significant roles in nurturing and supporting children​.

Suitable Family Lifestyles: Families impart lifestyle choices, such as preferences for education, recreation, and consumption habits. Changes in family dynamics, like career-focused parents, have shifted consumption patterns, increasing demand for convenience foods and leisure-focused products as parents seek quality time with their children.

*FAMILY LIFECYLES*
The family life cycle represents the life stages of a typical family. It is a composite variable that combines marital status, size of family, age of family members (focusing on the age of the oldest or youngest child), and employment status of the head of household, and then classifies the family into a “typical” stage. The ages of the parents and the relative amount of disposable income are inferred from the family’s stage in the cycle. 

*Bachelorhood*
The bachelorhood stage refers to young single men and women, mostly college educated, who have 
incomes that allow them to leave home and establish their own households. Increasingly, though, 
even employed college graduates continue to live at home and save toward setting up their own 
homes. 

*Honeymooners*
*The honeymooners stage refers to young and newly married couples. Educated, engaged couples have a combined discretionary income. 
* If both establish career paths, their incomes grow steadily. A spouse going back to graduate school usually calls for curtailing spending and a more moderate lifestyle.
* People with considerable discretionary incomes are prime targeting prospects. Most couples overspend on their weddings. * * Afterward, they are in the market for home furnishings, travel, and financial planning services. Because many young husbands and wives both work, these couples often have a combined income that permits them to purchase more indulgent possessions, as well as save and invest money.

*Parenthood*
* The parenthood stage designates married couples with at least one child living at home. This is the 
longest stage of the family life cycle. 
* he ad for toys that help children’s cognitive development in targets young parents 
* Parenthood (also known as the “full-nest” stage) usually extends over more than a twenty-year period. Because of its long duration, this stage can be divided into shorter phases. The preschool phase, elementary school phase, high school phase, and college phase.
* Throughout these parenthood phases, the interrelationships of family members and the structure of the family gradually change.
* Furthermore, the financial resources of the family change significantly, as one (or both) parents progress in their careers and as child rearing and educational responsibilities gradually increase and then decrease as children become self-supporting

*Post-Parenthood*
* The post-parenthood stage refers to older married couples with no children living at home. Because parenthood extends over many years, the start of this stage (also known as “empty nest”) is traumatic for some parents and liberating for others. 
* For many parents, this stage represents the opportunity to do all the things they could not do or afford while their children lived home or went to college.During this stage, most married couples are financially secure and have a lot of leisure time.
* They travel more frequently, take extended vacations, and are likely to purchase a second home in 
a warmer climate.
* They have higher disposable incomes because of savings and investments, and they have fewer expenses. They look forward to being involved grandparents.
* Therefore, families in the post-parenthood stage are an important market for luxury goods, new automobiles, expensive furniture, and vacations to faraway places. 

*Dissolution*
The dissolution stage refers to the family with one surviving spouse. If the surviving spouse is in good 
health, is working or has adequate savings, and has supportive family and friends, the adjustment is 
easier. The surviving spouse (women live longer than men) often tends to follow a more economical 
lifestyle. Many surviving spouses seek each other out for companionship; others enter into second (or 
third and even fourth) marriages (Chapter 12 describes the characteristics of older consumers).


Summary of the Family Life Cycle
The traditional family life cycle concept details the types of products and services that a household or family might be most interested in at each stage. In addition, it is also possible to trace how the family life cycle concept affects a single product or service over time.
