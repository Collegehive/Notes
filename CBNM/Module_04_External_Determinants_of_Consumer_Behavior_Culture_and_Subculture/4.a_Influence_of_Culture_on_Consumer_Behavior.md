# 4.a Influence of Culture on Consumer Behavior

Culture is the collective values, customs, norms, arts, social  institutions, and intellectual achievements of a particular society. Cultural values express the collective principles, standards, and priorities of a community. Most of the promotional 
messages across the world reflect, to some degree, the target audiencesâ€™ cultural values.

Researchers have conceptualized cultural norms at three levels:

1. Supranational level: Underlying cultural dimensions that span across national or cultural boundaries, such as regional characteristics, racial, religious similarities, or shared languages.
2. National level: Core values, customs, and personalities that define a country's "national character."
3. **Group level**: Subdivisions within a society, such as subcultures and reference groups.

At the supranational level, researchers identified four global youth segments (ages 14-24):

1. In-crowd: Focused on privilege and tradition, seeking approval through classic brands like Nike.
2. Pop Mavericks: Value individuality and personalization, favoring brands like Diesel and Adidas.
3. Networked Intelligentsia: Online creatives, drawn to cult brands like Vespa and Vans.
4. Thrill Renegades: Seek adrenaline and rebellion, rejecting conventional law and order.

Culture helps fulfill consumer needs by offering clear guidelines for daily decisions. It sets norms for:

- **Eating habits**: When and where to eat, and what foods are suitable for different meals and occasions (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, picnics, or weddings).
- **Perception of products**: Culture influences whether products are seen as necessities (e.g., mobile phones) or luxuries, evolving with societal trends.
- **Dress codes**: Specifies what to wear for various situations, such as at home, work, or social gatherings.

Overall, culture provides structure, helping individuals navigate social expectations and everyday life.
