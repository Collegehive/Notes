Consumer behavior stems from four disciplines. Psychology is the study of the human mind and the
mental factors that affect behavior (i.e., needs, personality traits, perception, learned experiences, and attitudes). Sociology is the study of the development, structure, functioning, and problems of human society
(the most prominent social groups are family, peers, and social class). Anthropology compares human societies’ culture and development (e.g., cultural values and subcultures). Communication is the process of
imparting or exchanging information personally or through media channels and using persuasive strategies.


Consumer Decision-Making

 The process of consumer decision-making, featured in Figure 1.10, includes the input, process, and
output stages of decision-making. The input stage of consumer decision-making includes two influencing factors: the firm’s marketing efforts (i.e., the product, its price and promotion, and where it is sold) and sociocultural influences (i.e.,
family, friends, neighbors, social class, and cultural and subcultural entities). This stage also includes the
methods by which information from firms and sociocultural sources is transmitted to consumers.

The process stage focuses on how consumers make decisions. The psychological factors (i.e.,
motivation, perception, learning, personality, and attitudes) affect how the external inputs from the
input stage influence the consumer’s recognition of a need, pre-purchase search for information, and
evaluation of alternatives. The experience gained through evaluation of alternatives, in turn, becomes
a part of the consumer’s psychological factors through the process of learning.
The output stage consists of two post-decision activities: purchase behavior and post-purchase
evaluation.
