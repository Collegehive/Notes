- **Variable Overheads:**
  - Material: Rs 5,000 at 50% capacity and Rs 6,000 at 60% capacity.
  - Labour: Rs 15,000 at 50% capacity and Rs 18,000 at 60% capacity.

- **Semi-variable Overheads:**
  - Electricity: 40% fixed and 60% variable.
  - Repairs: 80% fixed and 20% variable.

- **Fixed Overheads:**
  - Depreciation: Rs 16,500
  - Insurance: Rs 4,500
  - Salaries: Rs 15,000

## Answer

| Category      | Description | 50% Capacity (Rs) | 60% Capacity (Rs) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Variable Overheads** | Material | 5,000 | 6,000 |
|               | Labour   | 15,000 | 18,000 |
| **Semi-variable Overheads** | Electricity (40% Fixed, 60% Variable) | 12,600 | 13,680 |
|               | Repairs (80% Fixed, 20% Variable) | 2,700 | 2,760 |
| **Fixed Overheads** | Depreciation | 16,500 | 16,500 |
|               | Insurance | 4,500 | 4,500 |
|               | Salaries  | 15,000 | 15,000 |
| **Total Overheads** | | 71,300 | 76,440 |
| **Estimated Direct Labour Hours** | | 155,000 | 186,000 |
| **Overhead Rate** (Total Overheads / Direct Labour Hours) | | 0.46 | 0.41 |

### Working Notes

1. **Electricity:** At 50% capacity, fixed part is Rs (18,000 * 40% = 7,200) and the variable part is Rs (18,000 * 60% * 50% = 5,400). Total is Rs (7,200 + 5,400 = 12,600). At 60% capacity, fixed part remains Rs 7,200 and variable part increases to Rs (18,000 * 60% * 60% = 6,480), totaling Rs (7,200 + 6,480 = 13,680).

2. **Repairs:** At 50% capacity, fixed part is Rs (3,000 * 80% = 2,400) and the variable part is Rs (3,000 * 20% * 50% = 300). Total is Rs (2,400 + 300 = 2,700). At 60% capacity, fixed part remains Rs 2,400 and variable part increases to Rs (3,000 * 20% * 60% = 360), totaling Rs (2,400 + 360 = 2,760).
