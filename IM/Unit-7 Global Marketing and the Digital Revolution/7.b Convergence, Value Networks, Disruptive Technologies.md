# Convergence, Value Networks, and Disruptive Technologies

## What Is Disruptive Technology?

Disruptive technology is a kind of innovation that changes how we do things in a big way. It's the kind of change that makes old ways of doing things obsolete because the new method is clearly better. Think of it as the new kid on the block who changes all the rules of the game.

### Examples of Disruptive Technologies

- **E-commerce**: Buying and selling goods online, which has changed the retail industry.
- **Online News Sites**: These have transformed how we get our news.
- **Ride-Sharing Apps**: Apps like Uber and Lyft that have changed how we hire rides.
- **GPS Systems**: They've revolutionized navigation and location tracking.

## Brief History of Digital Revolution

The journey of disruptive technologies often starts small but grows quickly, becoming central to our lives. These innovations usually stand out right away to people who are quick to try new things.

### The Pattern of Disruption

Disruptive technologies tend to:
- Overturn old ways of doing things (like how we shop or hail a taxi).
- Have benefits that are obvious right from the start.
- Often come from new or smaller companies that shake up the status quo.

## Blockchain: A Modern Disruptive Technology

**Blockchain** is a game-changer behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It's like a digital ledger that isn't owned by any one person or company but is instead maintained by everyone who uses it. Here's how it's different:

- **Decentralized**: There's no central server; information is shared across a network.
- **Distributed Ledger**: It keeps a record of transactions on multiple computers.
- **Transparent**: Everyone can see the transactions if they're part of the network.
- **Peer-to-Peer Consensus**: Transactions are confirmed by consensus, not by one central authority.
- **Security**: Cryptography keeps things secure, making it really tough to tamper with.

Blockchain's way of verifying and recording transactions could change not just money, but how we do business, use services, and trust each other with data.
