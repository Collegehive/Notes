# Forces Affecting Global Integration and Global Marketing
## Global Integration
Global integration is when companies merge their operations and strategies across various countries to function as one cohesive unit. This approach ensures that a company's global activities are closely coordinated, leveraging worldwide resources and ideas to enhance overall efficiency and compete better globally. In short, it's about making the different parts of a company work together seamlessly across borders.

## Global Marketing
Global marketing takes the concept of global integration and applies it to marketing strategies, aiming to create a unified brand message and approach that resonates worldwide. Just as global integration harmonizes a company's operations across borders, global marketing synchronizes the company's marketing efforts to appeal broadly to international audiences. It leverages the global network to share ideas and resources, ensuring that marketing campaigns are efficient and effective across different regions. Essentially, it's about crafting and delivering a consistent marketing message that appeals to customers globally, utilizing the company's integrated operations as a foundation for global reach and impact.
